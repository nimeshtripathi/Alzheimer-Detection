# Alzheimer-Detection

Note: For the Deep Learning Part of the project, access to ADNI dataset is required.



Note: The values in the hyperparameters for the code are set at optimal values, however, they can be changed.


Part 1: Machine Learning 

Objective: Early onset of Alzheimer’s can be predicted through machine learning algorithms, but are not to the state of art yet.
Accurately predicting the different stages of dementia is still being worked and improved upon.
The machine learning and deep learning algorithms, have proved certain success in this field, but its not scalable enough currently.
Medical practitioners are still searching for this to be downscaled enough (in terms of processing required) so that it is available easily.
The main goal of this project is to predict the early onset of Alzheimer’s.
